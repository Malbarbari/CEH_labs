# CEH Labs — Practical Lab Notes & Write-ups

A concise, practical collection of my CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) lab work: step-by-step write-ups, configuration notes, commands and scripts used, screenshots, test results, and remediation recommendations. This repository documents hands-on exercises and lab recreations performed for learning and assessment purposes.

**What this repo contains (summary):** clear, reproducible lab reports that describe the objective, environment setup, tools and versions, the exact commands and techniques used during enumeration and exploitation, proof-of-concept evidence, and final remediation or mitigation notes. Scripts and automation snippets are included where they speed up repetitive tasks. Where relevant I record VM settings, network assumptions, and troubleshooting tips to help reproduce the labs reliably.

**How to use:** read a lab write-up to understand the goal, follow the environment notes to recreate the test bed, then run the documented steps and scripts exactly as shown. Use the PoC and screenshots to verify results and review the remediation section to learn how to fix the issues discovered.

**Prerequisites:** familiarity with networking and Linux basics, a modern browser, and common security tools (e.g., Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Python). Virtualization software (VirtualBox/VMware) is often required to spin up lab machines.

**Contributions & edits:** contributions and corrections are welcome—open an issue or a pull request with a clear description of the change, references, and any test results.

**Legal & ethical notice:** all material here is strictly for education and authorized testing. Do not use the techniques or tools on systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test. I am not responsible for misuse.
